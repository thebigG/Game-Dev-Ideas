# Title

Ninja Tricks (Since this was the original FB game, we should probably change it)

# Summary

There are two teams of ninjas (3 players each) competing to find hidden gems inside a specified area. The first team to collect all 9 gems wins the game. 

# Gameplay(Mechanics, rules, etc)

The area in which the teams are playing is 3x3 grid. Each team starts in the opposing corner.
Maps could be different scenarios - shopping mall, warehouse, dojo, etc.
Each player (ninja) can choose a specific element - fire, water, earth, air (maybe add more like lightning?)
The gems are obtained by interacting with different objects inside the area.
Gems can also be stolen from other players by successfully damaging them to a certain extent. This can be done in multiple ways, setting traps inside objects so that when the other player interacts, an effect takes place (stun, blast, slow). Another way is to cast abilities on other players (think jutsus) or by using your melee/ranged weapon.
There can only be a certain set of tools and jutsus equipped by a ninja at a given time, this allows for varied gameplay.
Additionally, based on the level of your ninja (experience gained by winning games), you can equip certain additional abilities as well - less affected by crowd control, faster movement when losing, higher chance of crit damage, etc.

    - This is an example of the entire game being played. This is 2v2 players which could also be implemented. There are many things to be noted here, bottom right corner shows which teams has which gems and also a mini map that shows where the players are and how many gems they're carrying. Bottom left has your abilities, health bar and mana (jutsu power). Top right has a summary of every players basic stats, health and mana. Top left has a chat system. The game looks very laggy and not too exciting right now but it really was when I was playing it (plus we can always improve it).

    - Another attractive feature of the game was that you could hang in the lobby and interact with other players - chat, dance, show off, etc.

# Story/Lore

*Have to think about this but I'm going to spin something off the top*

The gems are a sacred ninja relic that has been a source of pride/power for each ninja clan. Since some clans possessed more gems than the others, there was a disbalance in power which led to alliances and betrayals. In a great war between all the different clans, the gems got scattered in different parts and there's now an everlasting battle to gain supremacy. (Maybe this can also lead to a clan system in the game at some point)

As a ninja, it is your duty to restore honour to your clan. Join other ninjas and form a team to retrieve gems and learn from your experiences.

# Scope
- Time to completion
    - We could start super small - 2d game from a top view where you can move your character and "dash" into others. On a successful dash, you steal their gem.
    - The toughest part is going to be the multiplayer implementation
- Graphics can be compromised initially to make development faster.

# Notes
I feel if this does execute successfully, then this will have a lot of ways to let people grind for experience/in game money which would eventually lead to them buying more jutsus, costumes, abilities, etc.
