# Title:  
TBD(Working Title: Musical Defenders)

# Story: 
Music is an amazing medium that allows the spread of various emotions, and is very hard to curb. Thus, in a dystopian future, the govt. had completely banned public music events. In a rebellion against this rule, there is a huge event planned today. The govt. has sent in special agents to stop the event. These agents are the famed "silencers". We need to place instruments in their path that shall defend this place. If a single agent manages to enter the premises it is all over....

# Summary: 
This game is very similar to Plants vs Zombies(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies)
We have a building(Orchestra Hall?) that has 5 enterances, and 5 paths that lead to this building. We need money to buy instruments, all of which are useful in converting the "silencers" into music lovers :D. Different types of instruments are useful against different agents. Examples below: 
1. Players: Kinda useless in conversion and just rake in money. Each player gives more money when a silencer is converted(Kinda like sunflowers in the game)
2. Flute: Basic instrument. Low conversion speed but pretty consistent. 
3. Drums: Useful against silencers wearing earmuffs. 
4. Speakers: Useless on it's own, but allows nearby instruments to have a greater effect(and also allows them to work on helicopter riders)
And god knows what else we can think of. 

# Scope: 
Since we have only 1 "map", the background art shouldn't take much time. Since instruments are so common, we can easily use existing art for those, maybe have to make animations. Code shouldn't be too hard. 
Deadlines: TBD.
