# Summary

Ping Pong on fire!

# Gameplay(Mechanics, rules, etc)
![](../Images/Pong.jpg)
It is classic ping pong, except that the ball is on fire.


# Story/Lore
A programmer went back in time and showed the creators of
pong how to use particles. They also gave them an i5 Intel Core processor 11th generation.
With all this great power, plenty of time in their hands and some imagination, who
knows how else they will change history! Great Scott! 

# Scope
- I've made Pong before, so we could probably get it done in a couple of weeks;.
- This is mostly an execuse for me to play with 2d Particles in Godot :)


# Notes
Anything else that is noteworthy.
